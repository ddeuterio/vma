VMA

Your local CVE database.

Installation
============

Clone

Create an .env file with the following parameters and store it inside the docker/ directory

::

    DB_HOST=
    DB_USER=
    DB_PASS=
    DB_NAME=
    NVD_API_KEY=
    POSTGRES_USER=
    POSTGRES_PASSWORD=
    POSTGRES_DB=

Create the docker images for the services described in the docker-compose file:

::

    docker build -t vma:latest -f Dockerfile.vma .
    docker build -t web:latest -f Dockerfile.web .

Add the following to your /etc/hosts:

    vma.local 127.0.0.1

Modify the ./docker/docker-compose.yml file to your needs and run it

::

    cd docker
    docker-compose up -d

NOTE: this application is using self-signed certificates

Use your browser to get access VMA!

::

    https://vma.local:8443


If you want to periodically update the database, I recommend creating a cron job to launch the vma image.

In the following example, the job will run at 2 am every day:

::
    
    0 2 * * * docker run --rm --env-file <put here the path to your env file> vma -i
